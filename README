WordPress::Post - DEPRECATED see WordPress::CLI instead

SYNOPSIS
       use WordPress::Post;

       my $o= WordPress::Post->new ({ 
          proxy => 'http://this/xmlrpc.php', 
          username => 'lou', 
          password => '2342ss' 
       });

       $o->post({
          title => 'My Vacation Plans',
          description => 'Jump around. Sleep.',      
       });

DESCRIPTION
    This module is deprecated. See WordPress::CLI distribution instead.

    The module WordPress did not work for me. This one works.

    It lets you post to a wordpress blog/site.

    A script is included with this distribution, wppost. It allows you to
    post content via the command line. You can also have picture
    attachments.

METHODS
  new()
    Argument is hash ref. Keys are 'proxy', 'username', and 'password'.

       my $o= new WordPress::Base ({ 
          proxy => 'http://this/xmlrpc.php', 
          username => 'lou', 
          password => '2342ss' 
       });

    Method resides in WordPress::Base.

  post()
    Argument is hash ref. This is the 'struct' referred to in xmlrpc.

    Possible keys are:

       title - string
       description - body of your post, string
       mt_excerpt - string
       mt_text_more - boolean?
       mt_allow_comments - boolean?
       mt_allow_pings - boolean?
       mt_tb_ping_urls - boolean?
       dateCreated - cant figure out the right string
       categories - array ref

    Example use:

       $o->post({
          title       => 'This is what happened',
          description => 'Morning is when I wake up.',
          categories  => ['life','sleep'],
       });

    Returns post id. This is useful if you want to know how to reach it via
    the web right away. For example if your address for the wordpress blog
    is http://super.net/wp, then a post returning id '3' would be reached
    via http://super.net/wp/?p=3

  post_file()
    Argument is abs path to file you want to post. Returns url via which the
    file can be reached.

    This is useful in building more complex posts, with attachments, etc.

BUGS
    This module is in infancy. It works for me, and well.

    I need to figure out how to determine the date, dateCreated strings such
    as 2006-12-31 fail, I also tried '2006-12-31 12:00:00', still fails.

    Please contact the AUTHOR for any issues.

    To test I suggest you download the package and test it out by hand.

    For testing you will need to have a word press blog set up. You must
    also know the proxy address, a username and password.
