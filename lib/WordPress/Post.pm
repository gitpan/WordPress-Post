=head1 NAME

WordPress::Post - DEPRECATED see WordPress::CLI instead

=head1 SYNOPSIS
   
   use WordPress::Post;

   my $o= WordPress::Post->new ({ 
      proxy => 'http://this/xmlrpc.php', 
      username => 'lou', 
      password => '2342ss' 
   });

   $o->post({
      title => 'My Vacation Plans',
      description => 'Jump around. Sleep.',      
   });


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is DEPRECATD. See L<WordPress::CLI> distribution instead.

The module WordPress did not work for me.
This one works.

It lets you post to a wordpress blog/site.

A script is included with this distribution, wppost. It allows you to post content via the command line. You can also have picture attachments.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Argument is hash ref. Keys are 'proxy', 'username', and 'password'.

   my $o= new WordPress::Base ({ 
      proxy => 'http://this/xmlrpc.php', 
      username => 'lou', 
      password => '2342ss' 
   });

Method resides in WordPress::Base.

=head2 post()

Argument is hash ref. This is the 'struct' referred to in xmlrpc.

Possible keys are:

   title - string
   description - body of your post, string
   mt_excerpt - string
   mt_text_more - boolean?
   mt_allow_comments - boolean?
   mt_allow_pings - boolean?
   mt_tb_ping_urls - boolean?
   dateCreated - cant figure out the right string
   categories - array ref

Example use:

   $o->post({
      title       => 'This is what happened',
      description => 'Morning is when I wake up.',
      categories  => ['life','sleep'],
   });

Returns post id.
This is useful if you want to know how to reach it via the web right away.
For example if your address for the wordpress blog is http://super.net/wp, 
then a post returning id '3' would be reached via http://super.net/wp/?p=3


=head2 post_file()

Argument is abs path to file you want to post.
Returns url via which the file can be reached.

This is useful in building more complex posts, with attachments, etc.


   

=head1 BUGS

This module is in infancy. It works for me, and well. 

I need to figure out how to determine the date, dateCreated strings such as 
2006-12-31 fail, I also tried '2006-12-31 12:00:00', still fails. 

Please contact the AUTHOR for any issues.

L<WordPress::CLI> - replacement

=head1 INSTALLING AND TESTING

To test I suggest you download the package and test it out by hand.

For testing you will need to have a word press blog set up.
You must also know the proxy address, a username and password.
